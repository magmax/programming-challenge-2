=============================

Here you will find the solutions and writeups from participants of the [Tuenti Programming Challenge 2](http://contest.tuenti.net).

* __finalists/__: The solutions submited by the 15 finalists. Check their code, probably there are things to learn there :)
* __writeups/__: Some participants take the time to write down how they faced the challenges, a very interesting way of going into the mind of those programmers.
* __links/__: Links to all the participants that published their code online.

If your published writeup/code is missing, please drop us a note.
